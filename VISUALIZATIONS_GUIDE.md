# 📊 Visualizations Guide

Your project has **two types** of architectural diagrams!

---

## 🎨 Two Visualization Styles

### 1. ASCII Art Diagrams (`ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- ✅ Works everywhere (plain text)
- ✅ No special viewer needed
- ✅ Copy-paste friendly
- ✅ Terminal-friendly
- ❌ Static (no interaction)

### 2. Mermaid Diagrams (`MERMAID_FLOWS.md`)
- ✅ Beautiful on GitHub
- ✅ Interactive and clickable
- ✅ Export to PNG/SVG
- ✅ Professional looking
- ❌ Needs Mermaid support

---

## 🎯 Which Should I Use?

| Scenario | Use This |
|----------|----------|
| Reading on GitHub | `MERMAID_FLOWS.md` ⭐ |
| Reading in terminal | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Presenting to judges | `MERMAID_FLOWS.md` ⭐ |
| Documentation in code | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Export as image | `MERMAID_FLOWS.md` ⭐ |
| Quick reference | Either works! |

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Presentations
1. Open `MERMAID_FLOWS.md` on GitHub
2. Take screenshots of diagrams
3. Use in your slide deck
4. Or export directly from mermaid.live

### For Documentation
1. Use ASCII diagrams in code comments
2. Use Mermaid in markdown docs
3. Reference both in your guides

### For Team
1. Share link to `MERMAID_FLOWS.md` on GitHub
2. Everyone sees beautiful diagrams
3. No special tools needed

## 🎨 Example: Same Diagram, Two Styles

### ASCII Style (ARCHITECTURE.md)
```
User → Frontend → Backend → ML Model
  ↑                              ↓
  └──────── Response ────────────┘
```

### Mermaid Style (MERMAID_FLOWS.md)
```mermaid
graph LR
    User --> Frontend
    Frontend --> Backend
    Backend --> ML[ML Model]
    ML --> Backend
    Backend --> Frontend
    Frontend --> User
```

## ✅ Recommendation

**For your hackathon project:**

1. ⭐ **Primary**: Use `MERMAID_FLOWS.md` (GitHub renders beautifully)
2. 🔄 **Backup**: Keep `ARCHITECTURE.md` (works if GitHub has issues)
3. 📊 **Presentation**: Screenshot from GitHub or export from mermaid.live
4. 📝 **Code Comments**: Use ASCII style
