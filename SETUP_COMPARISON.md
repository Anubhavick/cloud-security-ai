## 🐳 Method 1: Docker Setup (Recommended for Hackathon)

### ✅ Pros
- **One-command setup**: Just run `make docker-up`
- **No dependency conflicts**: Everything runs in isolated containers
- **Works everywhere**: Same behavior on all operating systems
- **Easy to share**: Team members get identical environment
- **Production-ready**: Same images can be deployed to cloud
- **Clean system**: No need to install Python, Node.js, or dependencies

### ❌ Cons
- **Requires Docker**: Need to install Docker Desktop (large download)
- **Slower iteration**: Need to rebuild images after code changes
- **More resources**: Uses more RAM and disk space
- **Learning curve**: Need to understand basic Docker commands

### 📦 What You Get
- Backend in container (Python 3.13, FastAPI, all ML dependencies)
- Frontend in container (React, Vite, Nginx)
- Automatic networking between containers
- Health checks and auto-restart
- Production-optimized builds

### 🎯 Use Docker If:
- ✅ You want the fastest setup
- ✅ You're demoing to judges/audience
- ✅ You want "it just works" reliability
- ✅ You're deploying to production
- ✅ Multiple people need identical setup
- ✅ You want to avoid "works on my machine" issues

### 📝 Commands
```bash
make docker-up      # Start everything
make docker-down    # Stop everything
make docker-logs    # View logs
make docker-build   # Rebuild after changes
```

## 💻 Method 2: Local Development Setup

### ✅ Pros
- **Fast iteration**: Change code and see results immediately
- **Easy debugging**: Direct access to Python debugger and browser DevTools
- **No containers**: Lower resource usage
- **Native performance**: Faster than Docker on some systems
- **Full control**: Easy to customize environment

### ❌ Cons
- **Manual setup**: Need to install Python 3.13 and Node.js 24
- **Dependency management**: Virtual environments, node_modules
- **Platform differences**: May behave differently on Windows vs macOS
- **"Works on my machine"**: Harder to reproduce issues across team

### 📦 What You Get
- Python virtual environment with all dependencies
- Node.js project with npm packages
- Direct access to source code
- Hot reload for both backend and frontend
- Easy debugging with breakpoints

### 🎯 Use Local Setup If:
- ✅ You're actively developing/coding features
- ✅ You need to debug issues
- ✅ You want faster code-to-result cycle
- ✅ You're comfortable with Python and Node.js
- ✅ You don't want to install Docker
- ✅ You have limited disk space

### 📝 Commands
```bash
make setup-dev      # One-time setup
make run-backend    # Terminal 1
make run-frontend   # Terminal 2
```

## ☁️ Method 3: Cloud Deployment (OCI)

### ✅ Pros
- **Production environment**: Real cloud infrastructure
- **Scalable**: Can handle real traffic
- **Publicly accessible**: Share via URL
- **Professional**: Impressive for hackathon judges
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducibility

### ❌ Cons
- **Requires OCI account**: Need Oracle Cloud account
- **More complex setup**: SSH keys, Terraform, OCI CLI
- **Costs money**: After free tier limits (but generous free tier)
- **Slower iteration**: Deploy takes time
- **Network dependency**: Need internet connection

### 📦 What You Get
- VCN with subnet and internet gateway
- Compute instance (Always Free tier eligible)
- Object Storage bucket
- Security lists and route tables
- Docker containers on cloud VM

### 🎯 Use Cloud Deployment If:
- ✅ You want a public demo URL
- ✅ You're ready for final deployment
- ✅ You want to impress judges with production setup
- ✅ You need to share with external users
- ✅ You want real cloud experience
- ✅ You're familiar with cloud platforms

### 📝 Commands
```bash
oci setup config        # Configure OCI CLI
make init              # Initialize Terraform
make plan              # Preview changes
make apply             # Deploy to cloud
```

## 🎓 Recommended Workflow

### For Hackathon Teams

**Phase 1: Initial Development (Days 1-2)**
```
Use: Local Setup
Why: Fast iteration, easy debugging, learning the codebase
```

**Phase 2: Integration & Testing (Day 3)**
```
Use: Docker Setup
Why: Ensure everything works together, catch environment issues
```

**Phase 3: Demo & Presentation (Day 4)**
```
Use: Docker Setup OR Cloud Deployment
Why: Reliable demo, professional presentation
```

### For Solo Developers

**Quick Prototype**
```
Use: Local Setup → Iterate fast
```

**Sharing with Team/Judges**
```
Use: Docker Setup → Easy sharing
```

**Final Presentation**
```
Use: Cloud Deployment (optional) → Impress with production URL
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with Docker**: If unsure, start with Docker. You can always switch to local setup later.

2. **Use both**: Docker for demos, local for development. They can coexist!

3. **Git is your friend**: Commit often so you can reset if something breaks.

4. **Test early**: Don't wait until demo day to test your setup.

5. **Have a backup**: Export Docker images or have screenshots ready.

6. **Read the logs**: Most issues are solved by reading error messages carefully.

7. **Ask for help**: Check README.md, DOCKER_SETUP.md, and SETUP_GUIDE.md
